# Constraints

---

This section outlines the boundaries and limitations that may impact the
project, along with strategies to reduce their effect.

## External

These are constraints coming from the outside and we (as a team)
have no control over, for example:

- **Project deadlines - Timeframe & Milestones**
  - The project must be completed within 3 months, following these fixed deadlines
  for each deliverable.
    - Milestone 0 – Cross-Cultural Collaboration: June 2
    - Milestone 1 – Problem Identification: June 16
    - Milestone 2 – Data Collection: June 30
    - Milestone 3 – Data Analysis: July 21
    - Milestone 4 – Communicating Results: August 11
    - Milestone 5 – Final Presentation: August 25

- **Programming Language Requirement: Python**
  - The project must be implemented using Python only; other programming
  languages are not permitted
- **Tool and Platform Limitations:**
  - All code, documentation, and project deliverables must be managed and
  submitted through GitHub, as mandated by the program.
- **Device Limitations**
  - Impact: Limited hardware/software may restrict access to tools or processing
   capabilities.  
  - Mitigation: Encourage cloud backups, offer basic tech support, and adapt
   tasks to available devices.
- **Unstable Internet Access:**
  - Impact: Missed meetings or inability to access tools.  
  - Mitigation: Provide offline resources, record calls, and use low-bandwidth
   platforms when needed.
- **Team Size and Composition:**
  - The group consists of 6 members assigned by the program, not self-selected.
   All members will be expected to collaborate.

- **Time Zone Gaps:**
  - Impact: Real-time meetings can be hard to schedule across locations.  
  - Mitigation: Use asynchronous communication (e.g., Notion, Discord), rotate
   meeting times, and record important discussions.

## Internal: Involuntary

These are constraints that come from within our team and we have no
control over but we can work on mitigating them:

- **Skills level and Limited Technical Experience**
  - Impact: Team members have different levels of experience and familiarity
   with programming, Git&GitHub. Some tasks may take longer to complete.  
  - Mitigation: Offer learning resources, pair experienced and less experienced
   members, and divide tasks by skill level.
- **Limited Availability for Group Work**.
  - Impact: Difficulty finding common times for teamwork.  
  - Mitigation: Use polls and allow individual work on sub-tasks.

- **Work Commitments**.
  - Impact: Part-time or full-time jobs may limit participation.
  - Mitigation: Split tasks by availability, and plan ahead to reduce pressure.

- **Family Commitments**.
  - Impact: Unpredictable availability due to family responsibilities.
  - Mitigation: Maintain flexible schedules and encourage early communication
   about conflicts.

- **Academic Priorities (Exams, Deadlines)**.
  - Impact: Reduced focus or availability during exam periods or assignment deadlines.
  - Mitigation: Align project milestones with academic calendars to avoid overlap.

- **Language and Communication Constraints**.
  - Impact: Differences in language proficiency or communication styles may
   lead to misunderstandings or hesitation in expressing ideas.  
  - Mitigation: Use clear, simple language; incorporate visual aids; and
   provide concise summaries to enhance shared understanding and inclusion..

- **Stress from Balancing Responsibilities:**
  - Impact: Burnout and reduced productivity.  
  - Mitigation: Promote realistic timelines, check in with each other, and
   allow flexibility.

- **Tools Familiarity:**
  - Impact: Some members may struggle with new platforms.  
  - Mitigation: Share guides, keep the tech stack simple, and help each other learn.

## Internal: Voluntary

These are the constraints we have voluntarily chosen to help define and scope
 the project. They include:

- **Google Meet for Virtual Meetings:**
  - All scheduled virtual team meetings will be conducted via Google Meet.

- **Slack as Primary Communication Tool:**
  - All key team discussions and updates will take place on Slack, minimizing
   fragmented communication across platforms

- **Different Commitment Levels:**
  - Impact: Not all members may engage equally.  
  - Mitigation: Set expectations clearly at the beginning and follow up regularly.

- **Equal Contribution Ethic:**
  - Impact: Tasks may be slower to allow everyone to participate.  
  - Reason: Fairness and shared ownership are key values in our teamwork.

- **Educational Focus:**
  - Impact: More time spent learning instead of just finishing.  
  - Reason: We prioritize understanding and growth over just delivery.

- **No Paid Tools:**
  - Impact: Limited access to advanced features.  
  - Reason: To keep the project cost-free and accessible for all team members.
