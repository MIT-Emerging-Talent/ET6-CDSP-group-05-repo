# Learning Goals

## Collective

1. Understand the full data science process:
   we want to experience how a project moves from identifying a problem,
  to collecting and analyzing data, and finally
  to communicating insights to real audiences.

2. Improve Python skills for data cleaning, visualization,
    and basic statistical analysis.

3. Strengthen skills in remote team collaboration,
    including conflict resolution and decision-making.

4. Learn how to manage project milestones using GitHub project boards and retrospectives.

5. Understand how to critically evaluate the quality,
    bias, and relevance of datasets in a domain.

6. Improve ability to present data findings to non-technical
    stakeholders clearly and effectively.

7. Maintain a Well-Organized Repository: Keep documentation,
   data, and code well-structured and professional for public review.

8. Gain confidence using Git and GitHub, through active
    collaboration with our team using branches, pull requests, and proper documentation.
