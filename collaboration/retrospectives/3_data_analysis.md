# Milestone 3 Retrospective

## What went well

- We successfully cleaned and merged multiple datasets from UNESCO, UNICEF, and the World Bank.
- Our team explored trends in math proficiency and related indicators using appropriate visualizations and summary statistics.
- We were able to identify meaningful patterns between math learning loss and variables like school closures, digital connectivity, and out-of-school rates.
- We created clear, well-commented notebooks that can be easily understood and replicated.

## What was challenging

- It was difficult to find standardized math assessment data from 2020â€“2021, which limited our ability to directly measure the impact during the peak of the pandemic.
- Matching country names and ISO codes across datasets took more time than expected.
- Some datasets had many missing values or outdated information, especially digital connectivity data.
- Separating exploratory and analytical code into two clean notebooks required multiple revisions.

## What we learned

- System-level education data can reveal important trends even in the absence of student-level scores.
- Income level is a useful lens to compare global differences in pandemic impact.
- Data cleaning and integration are critical and time-consuming steps in any research project.
- It's okay to adjust the research question as we better understand the limitations of available data.

## What we could improve

- Create and use reusable functions for repetitive cleaning steps to make the code cleaner and more efficient.
- Plan ahead for standardizing country names and codes across data sources.
- Try to explore complementary datasets (e.g., learning recovery programs, internet access) earlier in the process.
