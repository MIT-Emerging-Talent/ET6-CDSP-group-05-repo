# Retrospective

## Stop Doing

* Scheduling meetings without ensuring the time works for everyone.

* Delaying the first meeting too close to the submission deadline.

## Continue Doing

* Communicating regularly and clearly through Slack.

* Dividing tasks fand assigning responsibilities.

## Start Doing

* Scheduling meetings earlier in the milestone to allow more preparation time.
* Using shared tools to coordinate availability (e.g., shared calendar, polling tools).

## Lessons Learned

* Time coordination is just as important as task divisionâ€”having a great
  plan doesn't help if no one can meet to align on it.

* Our communication and teamwork were strong, which helped
  us get back on track even with a late start.

* Flexibility and understanding among team members are
  essential for navigating scheduling conflicts.
