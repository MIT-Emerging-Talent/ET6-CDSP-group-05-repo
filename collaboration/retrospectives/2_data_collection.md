# ðŸ”„ Milestone 2 â€“ Retrospective

## âœ… What went well

- We successfully collected and cleaned multiple datasets from UNESCO, UNICEF,
   and the World Bank.
- We designed a reproducible data cleaning pipeline using Python and Jupyter Notebooks.
- We documented each dataset and built a clear visual model of our problem structure.

## ðŸ¤¯ Challenges we faced

- We could not find student-level math assessment data specifically
   **during the pandemic period (2020â€“2021)**. Most standardized testing was paused,
    and such data is often private or unpublished.
- Data availability was particularly limited for low- and lower-middle-income
   countries, especially for system-level indicators during the COVID-19 years.
- Country name formats varied widely across sources, requiring manual name
   normalization and ISO code conversion.
- Some contextual indicators, such as digital connectivity, were based on older
   household surveys and did not reflect real-time conditions during the pandemic.

## ðŸ’¡ What we learned

- Public data often needs significant cleaning and standardization
   before it becomes usable.
- Early alignment of country identifiers (e.g., ISO codes) is essential for
   clean merging across datasets.
- Domain knowledge (in this case, education systems) is key to interpreting
   which indicators are meaningful.

## ðŸ“ˆ What we can improve

- Plan more time for the data discovery phase, especially when exploring
   education indicators in low-income countries.
- Reach out earlier to domain experts or instructors for guidance on
   hard-to-find indicators.
- Keep a dedicated log or tracker of data sources, cleaning decisions,
   and challenges faced â€” to make documentation and retrospectives easier.
