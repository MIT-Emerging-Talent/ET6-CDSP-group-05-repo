# Milestone 1 Retrospective ‚Äì Problem Identification

## ‚úÖ What Went Well

- We successfully grounded our project in real personal experiences, which
   helped us frame a problem that feels meaningful and urgent.
- We were able to apply systems thinking to explore root causes behind math
   learning gaps post-COVID.
- Our final research question reflects both the scope of the problem and the
   practical constraints we face (time, data access, and tools).
- Despite challenges, we submitted all required deliverables for Milestone 1:
  - Problem Statement
  - Problem Domain (Systems Thinking)
  - Background Review
  - Resources List
  - Research Question

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges We Faced

- Communication across the team was inconsistent. Some team members were slow
   to respond or missed meetings without prior notice, which caused delays and confusion.
- Uneven contribution levels emerged during this milestone. A few members carried
   most of the workload‚Äîespecially in writing and organizing the documents‚Äîwhile
   others contributed minimally.
- We struggled with coordination around deadlines and file versions, especially
   in the early stages.
- Because of these challenges, much of the actual writing and structuring had
   to be completed by one or two team members near the deadline.

## üìö What We Learned

- Having a powerful story or shared experience doesn‚Äôt automatically translate
   into strong collaboration‚Äîclear team communication and accountability are essential.
- Assigning specific tasks to individuals with deadlines is better than assuming
   everyone will contribute equally without structure.
- A shared understanding of the problem is valuable, but a shared commitment
   to the work process is equally important.
- Communication plans and team norms need to be reviewed and adjusted regularly,
   not just written once.

## üîÑ What We‚Äôd Do Differently

- Create a detailed task board earlier in the process and check in more frequently.
- Be clearer from the start about expectations for participation, and address
   issues sooner when someone isn‚Äôt engaging.
- Use asynchronous tools (e.g., shared docs, weekly check-in forms) more
   effectively to make up for missed meetings.

## üß† Overall Reflection

Milestone 1 helped us form a strong conceptual foundation for our project, even
 though the process of getting there was more difficult than we expected. We have
  identified the key issue, scoped our research question thoughtfully, and outlined
   the constraints we'll be working within.

However, if we want to succeed in the next milestones‚Äîespecially during data
 collection and analysis‚Äîwe need to improve how we communicate, divide tasks,
  and hold each other accountable. We are committed to making those changes
   moving forward.
