# 🧹 Cleaned Data

This folder contains cleaned versions of the raw datasets used in our project.

Each file here has undergone basic preprocessing steps such as:

- Removing regional aggregates and keeping only countries
- Standardizing column names
- Converting country names to ISO 3-letter codes
- Dropping irrelevant columns
- Filtering out years we don't use in our analysis

## ✅ Purpose

The cleaned files are used as input to the final merging process, where we combine all variables into a single dataset:  
📄 `1_datasets/final_dataset.csv`

These files ensure consistent structure and comparability across countries and years before modeling.

## 📌 Notes

- Cleaning was performed using the script: `2_data_preparation/data_cleaning_script.ipynb`
- No imputation or interpolation was applied — missing values are retained
- All files use ISO 3-letter country codes (`ISO`) and standard column names
