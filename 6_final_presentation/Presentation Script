## Slide Deck Outline

### Slide 1 â€“ Introduction

We started by asking ourselves: what is a global problem that almost every student has felt in some way?  

Imagine being a student returning to school after COVID-19, only to realize youâ€™ve forgotten how to solve even simple math problems. This wasnâ€™t just one childâ€™s struggle â€” it happened in countries all around the world.  

Thatâ€™s why we chose to study **Math Learning After COVID-19**.  

---

### Slide 2 â€“ The Challenge

During the pandemic, about **1.6 billion learners** were affected by school closures.  

Math was one of the hardest-hit subjects, because it requires **regular practice, feedback, and teacher support**.  

The impact was especially severe in **low- and middle-income countries**, where many students had no internet, devices, or extra learning support at home.  

---

### Slide 3 â€“ Data Challenges

Working on this project, we also faced difficulties of our own:  

- The datasets were limited  
- In Bangladesh, the data was not in English, so we had to translate it  
- Contacting NGOs for deeper insights proved challenging  

But instead of stopping us, these challenges helped us **focus our work more clearly**.  

---

### Slide 4 â€“ Research Question & Approach

The central question we asked was:  

ðŸ‘‰ *How did math skills change during COVID-19, and what support can help students catch up?*  

To answer this, we:  

- Compared **math scores before and after the pandemic**  
- Examined factors like **school closures** and **teacher training**  
- Conducted a **case study in Bangladesh**  

---

### Slide 5 â€“ Findings

Our results were clear:  

- **Math performance dropped almost everywhere**  
- **Poor and rural students** suffered the biggest losses  
- But in countries with **stronger teacher training** or **better digital access**, the learning loss was smaller  

---

### Slide 6 â€“ Bangladesh Case Study

In Bangladesh, the numbers told the story:  

- Before COVID: **average math score = 77**  
- During closures: **score fell to 52**  
- After reopening: **partial recovery to 61**  

This shows the same global trend: **a sharp fall during closures, with only partial recovery afterward**.  

---

### Slide 7 â€“ Audience & Communication Plan

We believe research only matters if the right people hear it.  

Thatâ€™s why we created a **simple communication plan**:  

- A short **policy brief**  
- An **interactive data dashboard**  
- Sharing results with **NGOs, policymakers, and on LinkedIn**  

Our goal is to raise awareness and encourage **practical action**.  

---

### Slide 8 â€“ Recommendations

To close the learning gap, we suggest:  

- **Targeted math recovery programs**  
- **More teacher training**  
- **Affordable digital tools**  

These approaches can help fix most of the learning loss **at a much lower cost than making students repeat grades**.  

---

### Slide 9 â€“ Closing

To wrap up:  

COVID-19 left a deep mark on math education worldwide. But with targeted recovery programs, stronger teacher training, and smart use of technology, students can catch up.  

We are **Group 5 â€“ EduCatalysts**, and we hope our project inspires new solutions for math recovery after COVID-19.  

**Thank you. Suggestions and comments are warmly welcome.**

## Presentation Script

### 1 â€“ Introduction

Hello everyone. Iâ€™d like you to imagine being a student who comes back to school after COVID-19 and struggles to solve simple math problems. This was not just one childâ€™s story â€” it happened all around the world. Our project is about **Math Learning After COVID-19**.  

### 2 â€“ The Challenge

During the pandemic, about **1.6 billion learners** were affected when schools closed. Math was one of the hardest-hit subjects, because it needs regular practice and teacher support. The impact was the worst in low- and middle-income countries, where many students had no internet, devices, or extra help.  

### 3 â€“ Data Challenges

Our team also faced some challenges while doing this project. The data we needed was limited, and the Bangladesh data was not in English, so we had to translate it. It was also difficult to reach NGOs for more information. But these problems pushed us to focus our work more clearly.  

### 4 â€“ Research Question & Approach

So, the main question we asked was: **How did math skills change during COVID-19, and what support can help students catch up?**  

To study this, we compared math scores before and after the pandemic, looked at factors like school closures and teacher training, and did a case study in Bangladesh.  

### 5 â€“ Findings

What we found was clear: **math performance went down almost everywhere**. Poor and rural students lost the most. But some countries did better. Where teachers were better trained, and where students had digital access, the drop was smaller.  

### 6 â€“ Bangladesh Case Study

In Bangladesh, the average math score was **77 before COVID**. It fell to **52 during school closures**, and then improved a little to **61 after schools reopened**.  

This shows the same story we saw globally: a big fall during closures, and only partial recovery after reopening.  

### 7 â€“ Audience & Communication Plan

We think this research only makes a difference if the right people hear it. Thatâ€™s why we made a simple communication plan. We created a short policy brief, an interactive data dashboard, and we plan to share our findings with NGOs, policymakers, and even on LinkedIn. The goal is to raise awareness and encourage action.  

### 8 â€“ Recommendations

To close the learning gap, we suggest targeted math recovery programs, more teacher training, and affordable digital tools. These solutions can fix most of the loss at a much lower cost than making students repeat grades.  

### 9 â€“ Closing

Thank you very much. We are **Group 5, EduCatalysts**, and we hope our project helps inspire solutions for math recovery after COVID-19. Suggestions and comments are warmly welcome.
