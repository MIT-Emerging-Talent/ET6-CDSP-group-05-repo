MIT Emerging Talent – Group 5
Project: Math Learning After COVID-19

Slide 1 – Introduction
We started by asking ourselves: what is a global problem that almost every student has felt in some way?

Imagine being a student returning to school after COVID-19, only to realize you’ve forgotten how to solve even simple math problems. This wasn’t just one child’s struggle—it happened in countries all around the world.

That’s why we chose to study Math Learning After COVID-19.

Slide 2 – The Challenge
During the pandemic, about 1.6 billion learners were affected by school closures.

Math was one of the hardest-hit subjects, because it requires regular practice, feedback, and teacher support.

The impact was especially severe in low- and middle-income countries, where many students had no internet, devices, or extra learning support at home.

Slide 3 – Data Challenges
Working on this project, we also faced difficulties of our own.

The datasets were limited.

In Bangladesh, the data was not in English, so we had to translate it.

Contacting NGOs for deeper insights proved challenging.

But instead of stopping us, these challenges helped us focus our work more clearly.

Slide 4 – Research Question & Approach
The central question we asked was:

👉 How did math skills change during COVID-19, and what support can help students catch up?

To answer this, we:

Compared math scores before and after the pandemic

Examined factors like school closures and teacher training

Conducted a case study in Bangladesh

Slide 5 – Findings
Our results were clear:

Math performance dropped almost everywhere.

Poor and rural students suffered the biggest losses.

But in countries with stronger teacher training or better digital access, the learning loss was smaller.

Slide 6 – Bangladesh Case Study
In Bangladesh, the numbers told the story:

Before COVID: average math score = 77

During closures: score fell to 52

After reopening: partial recovery to 61

This shows the same global trend: a sharp fall during closures, with only partial recovery afterward.

Slide 7 – Audience & Communication Plan
We believe research only matters if the right people hear it.

That’s why we created a simple communication plan:

A short policy brief

An interactive data dashboard

Sharing results with NGOs, policymakers, and on LinkedIn

Our goal is to raise awareness and encourage practical action.

Slide 8 – Recommendations
To close the learning gap, we suggest:

Targeted math recovery programs

More teacher training

Affordable digital tools

These approaches can help fix most of the learning loss at a much lower cost than making students repeat grades.

Slide 9 – Closing
To wrap up:

COVID-19 left a deep mark on math education worldwide. But with targeted recovery programs, stronger teacher training, and smart use of technology, students can catch up.

We are Group 5 – EduCatalysts, and we hope our project inspires new solutions for math recovery after COVID-19.

Thank you. Suggestions and comments are warmly welcome.
