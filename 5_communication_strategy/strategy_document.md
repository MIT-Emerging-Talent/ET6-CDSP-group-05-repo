# ðŸ§© Communication Format

We created a **visually engaging 1-page policy brief** (PDF) that includes:

- A brief summary of our analysis
- Key statistics highlighting the severity of learning loss
- Evidence-backed policy recommendations
- A call-to-action for immediate intervention

This artifact is designed to be:

- Shared via email, presentations, or conferences
- Published on education ministry websites
- Printed and distributed among policymakers and stakeholders

## ðŸ§  Design Thinking Process

We followed a design thinking approach to ensure effective communication:

1. **Empathize**  
   We studied the context and constraints of policymakers in LMICs, noting their limited time, data needs, and focus on scalable, cost-effective solutions.

2. **Define**  
   We identified the core problem: "Policymakers may underestimate the long-term impact of pandemic-related math learning loss."

3. **Prototype**  
   We drafted a concise, actionable policy brief, focusing on clarity and visual impact. We included only high-level statistics and emphasized feasible interventions.

4. **Test**  
   We shared an early version with peer reviewers (Group 22) for feedback and made revisions to improve readability, tone, and effectiveness.

## âœ… Desired Outcome

We want policymakers to:

- Acknowledge the post-pandemic math learning loss as a critical issue.
- Integrate our recommendations into education policy discussions and planning.
- Allocate resources toward math recovery initiatives in primary education.
