# 📘 Policy Brief: Tackling Post-Pandemic Math Learning Loss in LMICs

## 🎯 Issue Summary

The COVID-19 pandemic severely disrupted education systems worldwide, with low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) bearing the greatest burden. Our research quantifies significant post-pandemic learning loss in mathematics among students, threatening long-term educational and economic outcomes.

---

## 📊 Key Findings

- 📉 Students across LMICs have experienced measurable declines in math proficiency post-pandemic.
- 🧒 Younger students and those in rural or low-resource schools are disproportionately affected.
- 📚 Recovery efforts remain fragmented and insufficient in many regions.

## ✅ Evidence-Based Policy Recommendations

1. **Implement Targeted Remedial Programs**
   - Focus on foundational numeracy skills in early grades.
   - Use diagnostic assessments to identify and address gaps.

2. **Invest in Teacher Training**
   - Equip educators with tools to support students with varied learning loss levels.
   - Promote adaptive teaching methods and peer tutoring.

3. **Leverage EdTech for Scalable Solutions**
   - Expand access to low-cost, offline-compatible learning platforms.
   - Encourage data-driven approaches to track progress.

4. **Engage Families and Communities**
   - Raise awareness and mobilize local support for student learning.
   - Include parents in goal setting and monitoring.

## 📣 Call to Action

**We urge education policymakers in LMICs to act now** by prioritizing learning recovery in national education agendas. Without immediate intervention, the learning gap will continue to widen, exacerbating inequality and undermining future development.
