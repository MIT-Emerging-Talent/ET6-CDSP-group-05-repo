## Target Audience

- **Primary**: Education Ministers & Policy Advisors (LMICs)
- **Secondary**:
  - International Organizations (UNESCO, World Bank Education Teams)
  - Local Curriculum Developers

### Core Message
>
> "Targeted math recovery programs can bridge 78% of COVID learning gaps at 1/3 the cost of grade repetition, based on Bangladesh case study + UNESCO global data"

### Artifacts

1. [Policy Brief](./policy_brief.md)
   A concise, visually engaging 1-page brief tailored for education policymakers in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The brief focuses on:

   - **Title**: Scalable and Cost-Effective Strategies to Address Pandemic-Induced Math Learning Loss
   - **Key Visuals**:
     - A global snapshot of learning recovery trends post-pandemic
     - A cost-effectiveness comparison of common interventions (e.g., Bridge Programs, Remedial Classes)
   - **Core Message**:
     - Urgent, data-driven interventions are needed to close post-pandemic math learning gaps — particularly for underserved communities

   The brief emphasizes scalable, budget-conscious solutions that can be rapidly implemented through existing education systems.

2. Data Dashboard — [Interactive Dashboard](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tpDZ0wg6AT8JyFbr3WtrYFN7_c2tpz0n?usp=sharing)
   - Interactive filters for:
     - Country income level
     - Urban/rural divide
     - Gender disparities
   - Sample query: "Show recovery rates for countries with <50% device access"
