# Research Question

**How did students in low- and middle-income countries experience changes
 in their Math learning proficiency during the COVID-19 pandemic, and what
  kind of support systems can address those gaps effectively?**

This research question emerged directly from our own experiences and
observations.

We focus specifically on:

- **Primary education**, where foundational math skills are formed.
- **Learning proficiency**, especially in math, which is highly sensitive to disruptions.
- **Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs)**, where digital access was limited
   or nonexistent during the pandemic.

This question addresses both the **impact** and the **recovery**: how learning
 changed, and what systems—whether teacher-led, community-based,
  or policy-driven—can meaningfully help students catch up.

## Why This Question Is Actionable

Our question invites data analysis and leads to solutions. It requires us to:

- Analyze student performance data before and after COVID-19.
- Identify differences based on geography, access, or intervention presence.
- Investigate which support systems (tutoring, condensed curricula, in-school
  recovery programs) were used in different countries, and whether they
    correlate with improved outcomes.

By focusing on both **change over time** and **response strategies**,
 this question can inform decision-makers on what works and where to act.

## Constraints We Considered

- **Data Availability**: Public data is mostly at the national or regional
  level (e.g., test scores, enrollment, dropout rates). Individual-level
  data may be limited, so we may rely on comparisons across countries or programs.

- **Feasibility**: We will use datasets from UNESCO, World Bank, PAL Network,
   and ASER. We aim to analyze trends using Python and simple statistical tools.

- **Scope**: We are focusing on primary-level education and on LMICs where support
   systems were most strained or absent.

- **Timeframe**: The project focuses on the 2018–2023 window, comparing pre-pandemic
   and post-pandemic data.

## Why This Matters

This research question is designed to produce insights that are:

- Relevant to ongoing education recovery efforts,
- Scalable across countries facing similar resource constraints,
- Informative for educators, NGOs, and governments designing interventions.

By identifying **where learning loss happened** and **which strategies helped**,
 we hope to contribute to more targeted, equitable support for the students
 who were left furthest behind.
