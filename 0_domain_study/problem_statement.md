# Problem Statement: Based on Personal Experience

During our group discussion, each of us shared personal experiences of how the
COVID-19 pandemic disrupted math learning in different but connected ways.

**Heba**  
Heba, a math teacher in a public school, spoke about the difficulties she faced
teaching during the pandemic. While some schools attempted remote learning,
many of her students had no stable internet, shared devices with siblings,
or no space at home to study. Teaching math online was especially challenging
because it depends on real-time problem-solving and personal interaction.
Even when students joined, they struggled to follow lessons.
When schools reopened, she found that her students had widely different
levels of understanding. Many had forgotten foundational concepts.
Despite her efforts, it was nearly impossible to give each student
the support they needed in large classrooms with limited resources.

**May Mon**  
From Myanmar, May experienced both the COVID-19 pandemic and a coup at the
same time. When the COVID outbreak occurred, she had just completed high
school and had to postpone her university education due to the pandemic.

**Nada**  
As a student, Nada faced a lot of difficulties during the COVID-19 pandemic,
especially in learning math. One of the main challenges was the weak internet
connection at home and the lack of enough devices. Her family had to share one
device among several members. Also, instead of live classes, teachers would
send recorded videos, but they weren’t clear, and she couldn’t understand
the lessons properly. It wasn’t just math. She struggled in many subjects.
She often felt lost and confused, and there wasn’t enough support to help her
catch up.

**Jubayer and Alexander**  
Jubayer and Alexander also shared their stories about the challenges they faced
in their education during the pandemic.

Together, these experiences show how the pandemic created serious,
unequal learning gaps, particularly in math, in many low and middle-income
settings. Teachers were overwhelmed, and students lacked access to the
most basic learning tools.

We believe this crisis demands urgent attention. Through data science,
we aim to explore how deeply these math learning gaps run, which groups
were most affected, and what interventions could help students recover
and succeed. Our goal is to inform recovery strategies that are fair,
targeted, and effective, especially for students and teachers in
under-resourced contexts.
