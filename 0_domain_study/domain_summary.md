## Problem Domain Summary – Using Systems Thinking

Our group’s understanding of the problem is shaped by both personal
 experiences and the broader context of how the COVID-19 pandemic affected
  education systems in low- and middle-income countries. To deeply analyze
   the issue, we applied a systems thinking approach using the **Iceberg Model**,
    which helped us go beyond the visible events and explore the underlying patterns,
     structures, and beliefs that sustain the problem.

### Event

The most visible symptom of the problem is the decline in **mathematics proficiency**
 among primary school students in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. In some
  cases, students returned to school with significant gaps in understanding;
   in others, they dropped out entirely.

### Patterns and Trends

These learning gaps are not isolated. They appear in various forms:

- Reduced math test scores across entire grade levels  
- Lower student confidence and engagement in math  
- Increased dropout rates, especially in under-resourced areas  
- Teachers reporting wide variability in student skill levels  

These trends are consistent across many low- and middle-income countries,
 especially where digital infrastructure was weak or nonexistent.

### Systemic Structures

Several systemic issues contributed to and sustained the learning loss:

- **Lack of digital infrastructure:** Many students had no access to internet,
   devices, or electricity during school closures  
- **Weak national response:** In some regions, no remote learning plan was
   implemented at all  
- **Teacher overload:** Even when schools reopened, teachers had limited
   time, training, or resources to address the wide learning gaps  
- **Inequality in resource distribution:** Urban schools with more resources
   recovered faster, while rural or poorer schools continue to struggle  
- **Inflexible curricula:** Many education systems expected students to move
   forward without adapting to the gaps created during the pandemic  

### Mental Models

Underlying beliefs and assumptions continue to hold these systems in place:

- The idea that students who fall behind are "not smart"
   rather than underserved  
- Belief among decision-makers that learning loss will "fix itself" over time  
- Cultural norms that may deprioritize girls' education or justify
   dropping out during a crisis  
- A lack of trust in data or systems to guide individualized interventions  

### Summary

The math learning gaps caused by the pandemic are not just about missed classes.
 They are the result of deeply interconnected social, economic, and institutional
  systems. Without structural changes, these gaps are likely to widen.

A **systems thinking** approach helps us see that solving this problem requires
 action on multiple levels:

- Changing policies  
- Improving data access  
- Supporting teachers  
- Shifting mindsets  

By recognizing these interconnected layers, we aim to identify the most
 influential factors in learning loss and explore interventions that
  can lead to meaningful, equitable recovery in math education for primary
   students in low- and middle-income countries.
