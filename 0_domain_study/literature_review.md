## Common Themes Observed  

1. **Disproportionate Impact:**  
   - Math proficiency declined more than literacy.  
   - Low/middle-income countries (LMICs) faced steeper drops due to
   **lack of digital infrastructure**.  

2. **Recovery Challenges:**  
   - Teachers report **heterogeneous skill levels** in post-pandemic classrooms.
   - "One-size-fits-all" approaches fail to address gaps.
