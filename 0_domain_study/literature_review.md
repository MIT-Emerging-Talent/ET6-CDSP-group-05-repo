# Literature Review Summary: Learning Gaps in Math Post-COVID  

## Background Review: Understanding Post-Pandemic Math Learning Gaps in LMICs

The COVID-19 pandemic triggered the largest disruption to education in modern
history, affecting over 1.6 billion learners worldwide. As schools shut down
to reduce the spread of the virus, education systems were forced to rapidly
transition to alternative modes of instruction.

While some high-income countries quickly moved to online learning, many low
and middle-income countries (LMICs) lacked the digital infrastructure,
training, and resources to do the same. In some countries, education came
to a complete halt for months or even years.

According to a 2021 joint report by UNESCO, UNICEF, and the World Bank, school
closures in LMICs often lasted longer than in wealthier countries.
The remote learning options provided, if any, were significantly less
effective. Nearly 463 million children had no access to any form of remote
education during the height of the pandemic. In regions like Sub-Saharan
Africa and parts of South Asia, the educational gap between children who
could and could not continue learning widened drastically.

Among the most negatively affected learning areas was **mathematics**.
Math learning requires consistent practice, scaffolded instruction, and
direct teacher feedback. It builds upon itself, so when foundational concepts
are missed, like place value, operations, or fractions, students find it
extremely difficult to progress. Unlike reading, which some students can
continue practicing through informal means like reading at home, math
instruction typically depends on structured learning environments, materials,
 and regular teacher input.

### Empirical studies support this decline

- In **Brazil**, a study found that the proportion of grade 2 students who
   could solve basic math problems fell by over **27%** during the pandemic.
- In **rural Kenya and Uganda**, Learning Loss Assessment data revealed that
   students returned to school after closures with math skills far below their
    previous levels, with some performing at **pre-primary levels**.
- Similar findings were reported in **Pakistan**, **South Africa**, **India**,
   and **Bangladesh**.

In addition to learning loss, the pandemic also **intensified educational inequality**.
Children from marginalized communities, including girls, children with disabilities,
refugees, and those living in poverty, faced higher risks of dropping out permanently.
Parents without formal education often could not support their children’s learning
at home, and in many cases, students had to take on adult responsibilities like
work or caregiving.

Even after schools reopened, the learning recovery has been **slow and uneven**.
Teachers are now dealing with classrooms full of students at very different academic
levels. There is often no diagnostic data to identify where students are struggling.
In many LMICs, education systems have not provided teachers with remedial tools,
catch-up programs, or specialized support for math recovery.

Several global organizations have called this a **generational catastrophe**.
The World Bank estimates that COVID-related learning loss could cost this generation
of students up to **17 trillion dollars in lifetime earnings** if not addressed
urgently. They also estimate that the global rate of **learning poverty**,
defined as the percentage of 10-year-olds who cannot read or understand
a simple story, rose to **70%** in LMICs during the pandemic.
Although focused on reading, the same pattern is likely true or worse for math.

The data also shows that **math proficiency** is a key predictor of long-term
 academic success, employability, and income. This makes recovery in this domain
  especially urgent. Yet, much of the current literature focuses on high-income
   contexts or general learning loss, without breaking down the impact on specific
    subjects like math or specific populations such as primary students in LMICs.

Our research seeks to address this gap. By using **data science tools** and
a **systems thinking lens**, we aim to examine the extent and causes of math
learning gaps in primary education across LMICs. This will include analysis
of performance trends, digital access, school closure lengths, and the
presence or absence of national recovery plans. Our findings can help
inform **targeted, evidence-based interventions** that prioritize the
most affected students and support equitable recovery.

## Common Themes Observed  

1. **Disproportionate Impact:**  
   - Math proficiency declined more than literacy.  
   - Low/middle-income countries (LMICs) faced steeper drops due to
   **lack of digital infrastructure**.  

2. **Recovery Challenges:**  
   - Teachers report **heterogeneous skill levels** in post-pandemic classrooms.
   - "One-size-fits-all" approaches fail to address gaps.
