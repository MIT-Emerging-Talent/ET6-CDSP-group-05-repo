# [Project Name:  "Quantifying Post-Pandemic Math Learning Loss"]  

This folder contains all the research and documentation developed for
 **Milestone 1** of our Collaborative Data Science Project. The focus
  of this milestone is to clearly define a real-world, data-driven problem
   based on our teamâ€™s personal experiences and domain understanding.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Theme

**How did students in low- and middle-income countries experience changes
 in their learning proficiency during the COVID-19 pandemic, and what kind
  of support systems can address those gaps effectively?**

Our project investigates post-pandemic learning gaps in **mathematics**,
 especially among **primary school students** in under-resourced contexts
  where digital remote learning was not available during school closures.

## ðŸ“‚ Contents

### `problem-statement`

A detailed narrative based on our personal experiences.

---

### `domain-summary`

A summary of our teamâ€™s understanding of the problem using systems thinking
 (**Iceberg Model**). We analyze:

1. **Event:** Declining math test scores post-pandemic.  
2. **Patterns:**  
   - Widening gap between high/low-income students.  
   - Increased dropout rates in Grade 5.  
3. **Structures:**  
   - Lack of devices/internet in rural areas.  
   - Teacher training gaps for remote instruction.  
4. **Mental Models:**  
   - "Online learning is ineffective for STEM subjects."  
This helped us identify root causes and shape a more strategic research question.

### `literature-review`

A thorough review of the global research landscape on pandemic-era education
 loss, with a focus on:

- Foundational numeracy decline  
- Learning poverty in LMICs  
- Inequity in access to digital learning  
- Long-term risks if learning gaps are left unaddressed  

This review supports our problem framing with data and literature.

### `resources`

A curated list of data sources, articles, and research institutions relevant
 to our topic. Includes:

- UNESCO, World Bank, PAL Network, ASER, J-PAL, Save the Children  
- Datasets and dashboards on learning loss, equity, and education recovery

---

### `research-question`

Our final, actionable research question:

**How did students in low- and middle-income countries experience changes in
 their learning proficiency during the COVID-19 pandemic, and what kind of
  support systems can address those gaps effectively?**

This question is specific, relevant, and grounded in both personal experience
 and available data.

## ðŸ”œ Next Steps (Milestone 2)

For **Milestone 2**, we will:

- Explore available education data sets (e.g., test scores, dropout rates)  
- Select a data model appropriate to our question  
- Begin collecting and documenting relevant data  

We are committed to improving team coordination and building on
 this foundation with clear, focused analysis.
