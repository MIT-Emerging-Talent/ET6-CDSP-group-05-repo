# [Project Name:  "Quantifying Post-Pandemic Math Learning Loss"]  

## Problem Statement

*"Our team's combined experiences in education, data analysis, and policy
research reveal a critical challenge: COVID-19 school closures caused Grade 3-5
students in [Country/Region] to lose 8-12 months of math proficiency,
disproportionately affecting low-income communities. Through [Teacher Name]'s
classroom observations, [Analyst Name]'s data work with [Organization], and
[Researcher Name]'s parent surveys, we identified three compounding factors:*

- **Access Inequality**: 60% of rural students lacked devices for online learning
- **Pedagogical Gaps**: Teachers received no training for hybrid math instruction
- **Assessment Blindspots**: Existing data systems failed to capture granular
learning loss

This created a 40% wider proficiency gap between socioeconomic groups
post-reopening, rendering traditional one-size-fits-all teaching methods
ineffective. Our project combines frontline educator insights, policy analysis,
 and data science to identify targeted recovery solutions."

## Research Question  

**"How did the COVID-19 pandemic affect primary math proficiency in
[Country/Region], and which interventions show the highest potential
for bridging these gaps?"**  

## Problem Domain Analysis  

### Systems Thinking (Iceberg Model)  

1. **Event:** Declining math test scores post-pandemic.  
2. **Patterns:**  
   - Widening gap between high/low-income students.  
   - Increased dropout rates in Grade 5.  
3. **Structures:**  
   - Lack of devices/internet in rural areas.  
   - Teacher training gaps for remote instruction.  
4. **Mental Models:**  
   - "Online learning is ineffective for STEM subjects."
