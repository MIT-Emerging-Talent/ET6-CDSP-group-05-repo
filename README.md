# 📊 Mathematics After COVID-19

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project aims to analyze and understand the global gap in mathematics
 proficiency among primary school students before and after the COVID-19 pandemic.
  The work focuses on comparing learning outcomes between 2019 and 2023 and
   exploring the possible role of factors such as:

- School closures  
- Education spending  
- Digital connectivity  
- Access to trained teachers

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Quantify the change in math proficiency across countries.  
- Identify patterns and factors that may have contributed to the learning gap.  
- Provide insights through visualizations and models to better understand
   the educational impact of the pandemic.

## 🔍 What We Did

- Collected and combined data from multiple international sources.  
- Focused on comparing math proficiency before (2019) and after (2023)
   the pandemic.  
- Investigated possible explanations for the learning gap,
   such as school closures, access to technology, and education spending.

---

## 💡 Key Questions

- How much did math proficiency change during the pandemic?  
- Which countries or regions were most affected?  
- What factors are most strongly associated with greater learning loss?

---

## 📈 Key Results

- Over 1.6 billion learners worldwide experienced educational disruption, with 463 million children unable to access remote learning.
- Field studies documented sharp declines in mathematics proficiency, including a >27% drop for Brazilian second graders and regression to pre‑primary skill levels in Kenya and Uganda.
- The affected cohort may face up to $17 trillion in lost lifetime earnings, and learning poverty in low- and middle-income countries could reach 70%.
- Structural issues like weak digital infrastructure, teacher burnout, and inflexible curricula deepened the gap.
- Country data show divergent paths between 2019 and 2023: Albania and Armenia improved, while Australia, Azerbaijan, and Belgium declined.
